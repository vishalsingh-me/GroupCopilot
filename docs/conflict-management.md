# Group Copilot Conflict Management Guide

## Principles
- Assume positive intent and stay calm.
- Separate people from problems; focus on shared goals.
- Make needs explicit, not implied.
- Use neutral, specific language.
- Seek small, testable next steps.

## Quick Scripts
- **Name the tension**: “I’m sensing frustration about timelines. Can we pause and map the blockers together?”
- **Ask for needs**: “What do you need to feel confident moving forward this week?”
- **Offer ownership**: “Who is best positioned to own this next step? I can propose options.”
- **Reset**: “Let’s summarize agreements in 2 bullets and pick the first action.”

## Steps
1) Acknowledge feelings and restate the shared goal.
2) List facts/constraints; avoid blame.
3) Ask each person for a need and a concern.
4) Co-create two options; check for consent.
5) Decide owners, deadlines, and a check-in time.

## When to escalate
- Repeated personal attacks
- Safety concerns or harassment
- Deadlines at risk with no agreement

Keep language short, calm, and action-oriented.
