# Conflict Management Guide

## Why conflict happens
Teams experience tension when goals, expectations, or communication styles do not align. Addressing issues early keeps collaboration healthy.

## Quick de-escalation scripts
- "I want to understand your perspective. Can you walk me through what you need?"
- "Let's separate the issue from the person so we can solve it together."
- "I might be missing something. Can we reset and clarify the goal?"

## Structured resolution steps
1. Name the problem clearly and neutrally.
2. Share impact using "I" statements.
3. Invite the other person to describe their view.
4. Brainstorm options together and pick one to try.
5. Agree on next steps, owners, and a check-in time.

## Escalation checklist
- We tried a direct conversation.
- We documented the agreement and next steps.
- The issue is still blocking work after 48 hours.
- We need a neutral facilitator (TA/instructor).

## Collaboration norms to reinforce
- Assume positive intent.
- State needs early.
- Keep feedback specific and actionable.
